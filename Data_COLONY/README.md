# Data_COLONY

This folder contains the required input data to perform the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2. Specific settings used to perform the analysis are outlined in the manuscript.

1. Data_Allele_Freq.txt: Allele frequencies for the 11 microsatellite loci (Hac_C7, Hb_C115, Hac_D1, Hb_B9, Hac_B4, Hac_B6, Hac_C114, Hac_A103, Hc_C7, Hac_A116, Hc_C126). Each allele is represented by a three digit number, followed be each corresponding frequency.

2. Data_Dyads.txt: Known maternal half-siblings for each maternal progeny array. First column corresponds to the seed ID, second column corresponds to the maternal plant ID.

3. Data_Genotypes_Moms.txt: 11 microsatellite loci (Hac_C7, Hb_C115, Hac_D1, Hb_B9, Hac_B4, Hac_B6, Hac_C114, Hac_A103, Hc_C7, Hac_A116, Hc_C126) for the collected maternal plants (n = 71). ID of each maternal plant is given, followed the multilocus genotype.

4. Data_Genotypes_Seeds.txt: 11 microsatellite loci (Hac_C7, Hb_C115, Hac_D1, Hb_B9, Hac_B4, Hac_B6, Hac_C114, Hac_A103, Hc_C7, Hac_A116, Hc_C126) for the collected seeds (n = 814). ID of each seed is given, followed the multilocus genotype.

5. Data_Marker_Info.txt: Per locus rate of genotype mismatches observed in our maternal progeny arrays
