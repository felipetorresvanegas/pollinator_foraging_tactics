# pollinator_foraging_tactics
Pollinator foraging tactics have divergent consequences for the mating system of a tropical plant

Data_COLONY: This folder contains the raw data required to perform the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2.

Mating_System_Parameters: This folder contains the R code necessary to estimate the proportion of particular types of mating events and to quantify correlated paternity at different hierarchical levels.

Output_COLONY: This folder contains the output from the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2, following the particular software settings that are outlined in the present manuscript.

Simulation_Modeling: This folder contains the R code necessary to: (1) create different mating scenarios to quantify false positive (FPR) and false negative (FNR) error rates; (2) perform pattern-oriented simulation modeling to infer the particular foraging tactic adopted by the pollinators of H. tortuosa; (3) perform a sensitivity analysis that included a full-factorial design based on a broad range of values for each parameter of pollinator foraging.
