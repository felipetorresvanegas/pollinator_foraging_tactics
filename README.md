# pollinator_foraging_tactics

This README.md file contains a general description of the data and R code implemented in the manuscript: Pollinator foraging tactics have divergent consequences for the mating system of a tropical plant. Each of the folders outlined below have a separate README.md file with a detailed description of the contents.

1. Data_COLONY: This folder contains the raw data required to perform the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2.

2. Mating_System_Parameters: This folder contains the R code necessary to estimate the proportion of particular types of mating events and to quantify correlated paternity at different hierarchical levels. This folder also contains the false positive (FPR) and false negative (FNR) error rates derived from the simulation modeling of different mating scenarios.

3. Output_COLONY: This folder contains the raw output from the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2, following the particular software settings that are outlined in the manuscript.

4. Simulation_Modeling: This folder contains the R code necessary to: (1) create different mating scenarios to quantify false positive (FPR) and false negative (FNR) error rates; (2) perform pattern-oriented simulation modeling to infer the particular foraging tactic adopted by the pollinators of H. tortuosa; (3) perform a sensitivity analysis that included a full-factorial design based on a broad range of values for each parameter of pollinator foraging.

5. Graphs: This folder contains the R code necessary to create the main figures in the manuscript. These correspond to the sensitivity analysis.
