# Output_COLONY

This folder contains the output from the parentage and sibship inference analysis in COLONY2.

1. Output_BestCluster.txt: 

2. Output_FullSibDyad.txt: This file contains the probability that seed pairs from the same maternal plant correspond to full-siblings.

3. Output_HalfSibDyad.txt: This file contains the probability that seed pairs from the same maternal plant correspond to half-siblings.

4. Output_ParentPair.txt: For each particular seed, this file contains the probability of the inferred paternal and maternal plant.

5. Output_Seed_Pairs_Among_Moms.txt: This file contains all possible pairs of seeds among the collected maternal plants. we considered the proportion of seed pairs that were classified as paternal half-siblings to estimate correlated paternity among maternal plants from the same sampling location (proportion of paternal half-siblings relative to non-siblings).

6. Output_Selfer.txt: This file contains the probability that a particular seed was a product of self-pollination.
